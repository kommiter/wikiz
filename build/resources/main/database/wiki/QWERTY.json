{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"25213":{"pageid":25213,"ns":0,"title":"QWERTY","extract":"QWERTY ( KWUR-tee) is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets. The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top letter row of the keyboard: QWERTY. The QWERTY design is based on a layout included in the Sholes and Glidden typewriter sold via E. Remington and Sons from 1874. QWERTY became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878 and remains in ubiquitous use.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In October 1867, Sholes filed a patent application for his early writing machine he developed with the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soul\u00e9.\nThe first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as shown below:\n\n- 3 5 7 9 N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n2 4 6 8 . A B C D E F G H I J K L M\nSholes struggled for the next five years to perfect his invention, making many trial-and-error rearrangements of the original machine's alphabetical key arrangement. The study of bigram (letter-pair) frequency by educator Amos Densmore, brother of the financial backer James Densmore, is believed to have influenced the array of letters, although this contribution has been called into question.:\u200a170\u200a Others suggest instead that the letter groupings evolved from telegraph operators' feedback.:\u200a163\u200a\nIn November 1868 he changed the arrangement of the latter half of the alphabet, N to Z, right-to-left.:\u200a12\u201320\u200a In April 1870 he arrived at a four-row, upper case keyboard approaching the modern QWERTY standard, moving six vowel letters, A, E, I, O, U, and Y, to the upper row as follows::\u200a24\u201325\u200a\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -\nA E I . ? Y U O ,\nB C D F G H J K L M\nZ X W V T S R Q P N\nIn 1873 Sholes's backer, James Densmore, successfully sold the manufacturing rights for the Sholes & Glidden Type-Writer to E. Remington and Sons. The keyboard layout was finalized within a few months by Remington's mechanics and was ultimately presented::\u200a161\u2013174\u200a\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - ,\nQ W E . T Y I U O P\nZ S D F G H J K L M\nA X & C V B N ? ; R\nAfter they purchased the device, Remington made several adjustments, creating a keyboard with essentially the modern QWERTY layout. These adjustments included placing the \"R\" key in the place previously allotted to the period key. Apocryphal claims that this change was made to let salesmen impress customers by pecking out the brand name \"TYPE WRITER QUOTE\" from one keyboard row is not formally substantiated. Vestiges of the original alphabetical layout remained in the \"home row\" sequence DFGHJKL.\nThe modern ANSI layout is:\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - =\nQ W E R T Y U I O P [ ] \\\nA S D F G H J K L ; '\nZ X C V B N M , . /\n\nThe QWERTY layout became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878, the first typewriter to include both upper and lower case letters, using a \u21e7 Shift key.\nOne popular but possibly apocryphal:\u200a162\u200a explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.\n\n\n=== Differences from modern layout ===\n\n\n==== Substituting characters ====\n\nThe QWERTY layout depicted in Sholes's 1878 patent is slightly different from the modern layout, most notably in the absence of the numerals 0 and 1, with each of the remaining numerals shifted one position to the left of their modern counterparts. The letter M is located at the end of the third row to the right of the letter L rather than on the fourth row to the right of the N, the letters X and C are reversed, and most punctuation marks are in different positions or are missing entirely. 0 and 1 were omitted to simplify the design and reduce the manufacturing and maintenance costs; they were chosen specifically because they were \"redundant\" and could be recreated using other keys. Typists who learned on these machines learned the habit of using the uppercase letter I (or lowercase letter L) for the digit one, and the uppercase O for the zero.\nThe 0 key was added and standardized in its modern position early in the history of the typewriter, but the 1 and exclamation point were left off some typewriter keyboards into the 1970s.\n\n\n==== Combined characters ====\n\nIn early designs, some characters were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage in the same position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on post-mechanical keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon (;) was produced by printing a comma (,) over a colon (:). As the backspace key is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized to move in the opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance only after releasing the space bar.\nIn the era of mechanical typewriters, combined characters such as \u00e9 and \u00f5 were created by the use of dead keys for the diacritics (\u2032, ~), which did not move the paper forward. Thus the \u2032 and e would be printed at the same location on the paper, creating \u00e9.\n\n\n=== Contemporaneous alternatives ===\n\nThere were no particular technological requirements for the QWERTY layout, since at the time there were ways to make a typewriter without the \"up-stroke\" typebar mechanism that had required it to be devised. Not only were there rival machines with \"down-stroke\" and \"front stroke\" positions that gave a visible printing point, the problem of typebar clashes could be circumvented completely: examples include Thomas Edison's 1872 electric print-wheel device which later became the basis for Teletype machines; Lucien Stephen Crandall's typewriter (the second to come onto the American market in 1883) whose type was arranged on a cylindrical sleeve; the Hammond typewriter of 1885 which used a semi-circular \"type-shuttle\" of hardened rubber (later light metal); and the Blickensderfer typewriter of 1893 which used a type wheel. The early Blickensderfer's \"Ideal\" keyboard was also non-QWERTY, instead having the sequence \"DHIATENSOR\" in the home row, these 10 letters being capable of composing 70% of the words in the English language.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nAlternating hands while typing is a desirable trait in a keyboard design. While one hand types a letter, the other hand can prepare to type the next letter, making the process faster and more efficient. In the QWERTY layout many more words can be spelled using only the left hand than the right hand. Thousands of English words can be spelled using only the left hand, while only a couple of hundred words can be typed using only the right hand (the three most frequent letters in the English language, ETA, are all typed with the left hand). In addition, more typing strokes are done with the left hand in the QWERTY layout. This is helpful for left-handed people but disadvantageous for right-handed people.\nContrary to popular belief, the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down,:\u200a162\u200a but rather to speed up typing. Indeed, there is evidence that, aside from the issue of jamming, placing often-used keys farther apart increases typing speed, because it encourages alternation between the hands. (On the other hand, in the German keyboard the Z has been moved between the T and the U to help type the frequent digraphs TZ and ZU in that language.) Almost every word in the English language contains at least one vowel letter, but on the QWERTY keyboard only the vowel letter A is on the home row, which requires the typist's fingers to leave the home row for most words.\nA feature much less commented on than the order of the keys is that the keys do not form a rectangular grid, but rather each column slants diagonally. This is because of the mechanical linkages \u2013 each key is attached to a lever, and hence the offset prevents the levers from running into each other \u2013 and has been retained in most electronic keyboards. Some keyboards, such as the Kinesis or TypeMatrix, retain the QWERTY layout but arrange the keys in vertical columns, to reduce unnecessary lateral finger motion.\n\n\n== Computer keyboards ==\n\nThe first computer terminals such as the Teletype were typewriters that could produce and be controlled by various computer codes. These used the QWERTY layouts and added keys such as escape Esc which had special meanings to computers. Later keyboards added function keys and arrow keys. Since the standardization of personal computers and Windows after the 1980s, most full-sized computer keyboards have followed this standard (see drawing at right). This layout has a separate numeric keypad for data entry at the right, 12 function keys across the top, and a cursor section to the right and center with keys for Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down with cursor arrows in an inverted-T shape.\n\n\n=== Diacritical marks ===\nQWERTY was designed for English, a language with accents ('diacritics') appearing only in a few words of foreign origin.  The standard US keyboard has no provision for these at all; the need was later met by the so-called \"US-International\" keyboard mapping, which uses \"dead keys\" to type accents without having to add more physical keys. (The same principle is used in the standard US keyboard layout for macOS, but in a different way). Most European (including UK) keyboards for PCs have an AltGr key ('Alternative Graphics' key, replaces the right Alt key) that enables easy access to the most common diacritics used in the territory where sold. For example, default keyboard mapping for the UK/Ireland keyboard has the diacritics used in Irish but these are rarely printed on the keys; but to type the accents used in Welsh and Scots Gaelic requires the use of a \"UK Extended\" keyboard mapping and the dead key or compose key method. This arrangement applies to Windows, ChromeOS and Linux; macOS computers have different techniques. The US International and UK Extended mappings provide many of the diacritics needed for students of other European languages.\n\n\n=== Other keys and characters ===\n\nSome QWERTY keyboards have alt codes, in which holding Alt while inputting a sequence of numbers on a numeric keypad allows the entry of special characters. For example, Alt+163 results in \u00fa (a Latin lowercase letter u with an acute accent).\n\n\n== Specific language variants ==\n\nMinor changes to the arrangement are made for other languages. There are a large number of different keyboard layouts used for different languages written in Latin script. They can be divided into three main families according to where the Q, A, Z, M, and Y keys are placed on the keyboard. These are usually named after the first six letters, for example this QWERTY layout and the AZERTY layout.\nIn this section you will also find keyboard layouts that include some additional symbols of other languages. But they are different from layouts that were designed with the goal to be usable for multiple languages (see Multilingual variants).\nThe following sections give general descriptions of QWERTY keyboard variants along with details specific to certain operating systems. The emphasis is on Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n=== English ===\n\n\n==== Canada ====\n\nEnglish-speaking Canadians have traditionally used the same keyboard layout as in the United States, unless they are in a position where they have to write French on a regular basis. French-speaking Canadians respectively have favoured the Canadian French keyboard layout (see French (Canada), below).\nThe CSA keyboard is the official multilingual keyboard layout of Canada.\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland use a keyboard layout based on the 48-key version defined in the (now withdrawn) British Standard BS 4822. It is very similar to that of the United States, but has an AltGr key and a larger \u21b5 Enter key, includes \u00a3 and \u20ac signs and some rarely used EBCDIC symbols (\u00ac, \u00a6), and uses different positions for the characters @, \", #, ~, \\, and |.\nThe BS 4822:1994 standard did not make any use of the AltGr key and lacked support for any non-ASCII characters other than \u00ac and \u00a3. It also assigned a key for the non-ASCII character broken bar \u00a6, but lacked one for the far more commonly used ASCII character vertical bar |. It also lacked support for various diacritics used in the Welsh alphabet, and the Scots Gaelic alphabet; and also is missing the letter yogh, \u021d, used very rarely in the Scots language. Therefore, various manufacturers have modified or extended the BS 4822 standard:\n\nThe B00 key (left of Z), shifted, results in vertical bar | on some systems (e.g. Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout and Linux/X11 UK/Ireland keyboard layout), rather than the broken bar \u00a6 assigned by BS 4822 and provided in some systems (e.g. IBM OS/2 UK166 keyboard layout)\nThe E00 key (left of 1) with AltGr provides either vertical bar | (OS/2's UK166 keyboard layout, Linux/X11 UK keyboard layout) or broken bar \u00a6 (Microsoft Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout)\nSupport for the diacritics needed for Scots Gaelic and Welsh was added to Windows and ChromeOS using a \"UK-extended\" setting (see below); Linux and X11 systems have an explicit or reassigned Compose key for this purpose.\n\n\n===== UK Apple keyboard =====\n\nThe British version of the Apple Keyboard does not use the standard UK layout. Instead, some older versions have the US layout (see below) with a few differences: the \u00a3 sign is reached by \u21e7 Shift+3 and the # sign by \u2325 Option+3, the opposite to the US layout. The \u20ac is also present and is typed with \u2325 Option+2. Umlauts are reached by typing \u2325 Option+U and then the vowel, and \u00df is reached by typing \u2325 Option+S.\nNewer Apple \"British\" keyboards use a layout that is relatively unlike either the US or traditional UK keyboard. It uses an elongated return key, a shortened left \u21e7 Shift with ` and ~ in the newly created position, and in the upper left of the keyboard are \u00a7 and \u00b1 instead of the traditional EBCDIC codes. The middle-row key that fits inside the return key has \\ and Pipe symbol.\n\n\n==== United States ====\n\nThe arrangement of the character input keys and the \u21e7 Shift keys contained in this layout is specified in the US national standard ANSI-INCITS 154-1988 (R1999) (formerly ANSI X3.154-1988 (R1999)), where this layout is called \"ASCII keyboard\". The complete US keyboard layout, as it is usually found, also contains the usual function keys in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 9995-2, although this is not explicitly required by the US American national standard.\nUS keyboards are used not only in the United States, but also in many other English-speaking places (except UK and Ireland), including India, Australia, Anglophone Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Indonesia that uses the same 26-letter alphabets as English. In many other English-speaking jurisdictions (e.g., Canada, Australia, the Caribbean nations, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, New Zealand, and South Africa), local spelling sometimes conforms more closely to British English usage, although these nations decided to use a US English keyboard layout. Until Windows 8 and later versions, when Microsoft separated the settings, this had the undesirable side effect of also setting the language to US English, rather than the local orthography.\nThe US keyboard layout has a second Alt instead of the AltGr key and does not use any dead keys; this makes it inefficient for all but a handful of languages (unless the 'US-International' keyboard mapping is used, see below). On the other hand, the US keyboard layout (or the similar UK layout) is occasionally used by programmers in countries where the keys for [{ are located in less convenient positions on the locally customary layout.\nOn some keyboards the \u21b5 Enter is bigger than traditionally and takes up also a part of the line above, more or less the area of the traditional location of the \\ key. In these cases the backslash is located in alternative places. It can be situated one line above the default location, on the right of the = key. Sometimes it is placed one line below its traditional situation, on the right of the ' (in these cases the \u21b5 Enter key is narrower than usual on the line of its default location). It may also be two lines below its default situation on the right of a narrower than traditionally right \u21e7 Shift key.\n\n\n=== Arabic ===\nTwo keyboard layouts that are based on Qwerty are used in Arabic-speaking countries. Microsoft designate them as Arabic (101) and Arabic (102).\nIn both the number line is identical to the American layout, beside  ( ) being mirrored, and not including the key to the left of  1. \nThe  \\ key on the right side of the keyboard is also the same. | could also be produced by shifting the key on the left side of the keyboard. \"? are produced by shifting the same keys, but ? is mirrored to \u061f. In Arabic (102) it's true also for {} which are again mirrored.\nFinally, , instead of being the normal output of their keys, are produced by shifting the same keys.\n\n\n=== Czech ===\n\nThe typewriter came to the Czech-speaking area in the late 19th century, when it was part of Austria-Hungary where German was the dominant language of administration. Therefore, Czech typewriters have the QWERTZ layout.\nHowever, with the introduction of imported computers, especially since the 1990s, the QWERTY keyboard layout is frequently used for computer keyboards. The Czech QWERTY layout differs from QWERTZ in that the characters (e.g. @$& and others) missing from the Czech keyboard are accessible with AltGr on the same keys where they are located on an American keyboard. In Czech QWERTZ keyboards the positions of these characters accessed through AltGr differs.\n\n\n=== Danish ===\n\nBoth the Danish and Norwegian keyboards include dedicated keys for the letters \u00c5/\u00e5, \u00c6/\u00e6 and \u00d8/\u00f8, but the placement is a little different, as the \u00c6 and \u00d8 keys are swapped on the Norwegian layout. (The Finnish\u2013Swedish keyboard is also largely similar to the Norwegian layout, but the \u00d8 and \u00c6 are replaced with \u00d6 and \u00c4. On some systems, the Danish keyboard may allow typing \u00d6/\u00f6 and \u00c4/\u00e4 by holding the AltGr or \u2325 Option key while striking \u00d8 and \u00c6, respectively.) Computers with Windows are commonly sold with \u00d6\u00d8\u00c6 and \u00c4\u00c6\u00d8  printed on the two keys, allowing same computer hardware to be sold in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with different operating system settings.\n\n\n=== Dutch (Netherlands) ===\n\nThough it is seldom used (most Dutch keyboards use US International layout), the Dutch layout uses QWERTY but has additions for the \u20ac sign, the diaresis (\u00a8), and the braces ({ }) as well as different locations for other symbols. An older version contained a single-stroke key for the Dutch character IJ/ij, which is usually typed by the combination of I and J. In the 1990s, there was a version with the now-obsolete florin sign (Dutch: guldenteken) for IBM PCs.\nIn Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), \"AZERTY\" keyboards are used instead, due to influence from the French-speaking part of Belgium.\nSee also #US-International in the Netherlands below.\n\n\n=== Estonian ===\n\nThe keyboard layout used in Estonia is virtually the same as the Swedish layout. The main difference is that the  \u00c5 and \u00a8 keys (to the right of P) are replaced with \u00dc and \u00d5 respectively (the latter letter being the most distinguishing feature of the Estonian alphabet). Some special symbols and dead keys are also moved around.\n\n\n=== Faroese ===\n\nThe same as the Danish layout with added \u0110 (Eth), since the Faroe Islands are a self-governed part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\n\n=== French (Canada) ===\n\nThis keyboard layout is commonly used in Canada by French-speaking Canadians. It is the most common layout for laptops and stand-alone keyboards aimed at the Francophone market. Unlike the AZERTY layout used in France and Belgium, it is a QWERTY layout and as such is also relatively commonly used by English speakers in the US and Canada (accustomed to using US standard QWERTY keyboards) for easy access to the accented letters found in some French loanwords. It can be used to type all accented French characters, as well as some from other languages, and serves all English functions as well. It is popular mainly because of its close similarity to the basic US keyboard commonly used by English-speaking Canadians and Americans and historical use of US-made typewriters by French-Canadians. It can also easily 'map' to or from a standard US QWERTY keyboard with the sole loss the guillemet/degree sign key. Its significant difference from the US standard is that the right Alt key is reconfigured as an AltGr key that gives easy access to a further range of characters (marked in blue and red on the keyboard image. Blue indicates an alternative character that will display as typed. Red indicates a dead key: the diacritic will be applied to the next vowel typed.)\nIn some variants, the key names are translated to French:\n\n\u21ea Caps Lock is Fix Maj or Verr Maj (short for Fixer/Verrouiller Majuscule, meaning Lock Uppercase).\n\u21b5 Enter is \u21b5 Entr\u00e9e.\nEsc is \u00c9chap.\n\n\n=== Greek ===\n\nThe stress accents, indicated in red, are produced by pressing that key (or shifted key) followed by an appropriate vowel.\nUse of the AltGr key may produce the characters shown in blue.\n\n\n=== German ===\n\nGermany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg use QWERTZ layouts, where the letter Z is to the right of T.\n\n\n=== Icelandic ===\n\nThe Icelandic keyboard layout is different from the standard QWERTY keyboard because the Icelandic alphabet has some special letters, most of which it shares with the other Nordic countries:\n\u00de/\u00fe, \u00d0/\u00f0, \u00c6/\u00e6, and \u00d6/\u00f6. (\u00c6/\u00e6 also occurs in Norwegian, Danish and Faroese, \u00d0/\u00f0 in Faroese, and \u00d6/\u00f6 in Swedish, Finnish and Estonian. In Norwegian \u00d6/\u00f6 could be substituted for \u00d8/\u00d8 which is the same sound/letter and is widely understood).\nThe letters \u00c1/\u00e1, \u00dd/\u00fd, \u00da/\u00fa, \u00cd/\u00ed, and \u00c9/\u00e9 are produced by first pressing the \u00b4 dead key and then the corresponding letter. The Nordic letters \u00c5/\u00e5 and \u00c4/\u00e4 can be produced by first pressing \u00b0, located below the Esc key, and \u21e7 Shift+\u00b0 (for \u00a8, two dots) which also works for the non-Nordic \u00ff, \u00dc/\u00fc, \u00cf/\u00ef, and \u00cb/\u00eb. These letters are not used natively in Icelandic, but may have been implemented for ease of communication in other Nordic languages. Additional diacritics may be found behind the AltGr key: AltGr++ for \u02cb (freestanding grave accent, \"backtick\") and AltGr+\u00b4 for \u02c6 (freestanding circumflex).\n\n\n=== Irish ===\n\nMicrosoft Windows includes an Irish layout which supports acute accents with AltGr for the Irish language and grave accents with the ` dead key for Scots Gaelic. The other Insular Celtic languages have their own layout. The default UK/Irish layout supports acute accents as standard and is thus more commonly used.\n\n\n=== Italian ===\n\nBraces (right above square brackets and shown in purple) are given with both AltGr+\u21e7 Shift pressed.\nThe tilde (~) and backquote (`) characters are not present on the Italian keyboard layout (with Linux, they are available by pressing AltGr+Shif+\u00ec, and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift+'; Windows might not recognise these keybindings).\nWhen using Microsoft Windows, the standard Italian keyboard layout does not allow one to write 100% correct Italian language, since it lacks capital accented vowels, and in particular the \u00c8 key. The common workaround is writing E' (E followed by an apostrophe) instead, or relying on the auto-correction feature of several word processors when available. It is possible to obtain the \u00c8 symbol in MS Windows by typing Alt+0200. Mac users, however, can write the correct accented character by pressing \u21e7 Shift+\u2325 Option+E or, in the usual Mac way, by pressing the correct key for the accent (in this case Alt+9) and subsequently pressing the wanted letter (in this case \u21e7 Shift+E). Linux users can also write it by pressing the \u00e8 key with \u21ea Caps Lock enabled.\nThere is an alternate layout, which differs only in disposition of characters accessible through AltGr, and includes the tilde and the curly brackets. It is commonly used in IBM keyboards.\nItalian typewriters often have the QZERTY layout instead.\nThe Italian-speaking part of Switzerland uses the QWERTZ keyboard.\n\n\n=== Latvian ===\nAlthough rarely used, a keyboard layout specifically designed for the Latvian language called \u016aGJRMV exists. The Latvian QWERTY keyboard layout is most commonly used; its layout is the same as Latin ones, but with a dead key, which allows entering special characters (\u0101\u010d\u0113\u0123\u012b\u0137\u013c\u0146\u00f5\u0157\u0161\u016b\u017e). The most common dead key is the apostrophe ', which is followed by AltGr (Windows default for Latvian layout). Some prefer using the tick `.\n\n\n=== Lithuanian ===\nIn a Lithuanian QWERTY keyboard, the keys \u0104, \u010c,\u0118, \u0116, \u012e, \u0160, \u0172, \u016a and \u017d are in places of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and = respectively in standard QWERTY. The numbers should be typed in combination with the AltGr key. Aside from these changes the keyboard is standard QWERTY. Besides QWERTY, the \u0104\u017dERTY layout without the alteration of the number row is used.\n\n\n=== Maltese ===\nThe Maltese language uses Unicode (UTF-8) to display the Maltese diacritics: \u010b \u010a; \u0121 \u0120; \u0127 \u0126; \u017c \u017b (together with \u00e0 \u00c0; \u00e8 \u00c8; \u00ec \u00cc; \u00f2 \u00d2; \u00f9 \u00d9). There are two standard keyboard layouts Archived 8 December 2015 at the Wayback Machine for Maltese, according to \"MSA 100:2002 Maltese Keyboard Standard\"; one of 47 keys and one of 48 keys. The 48-key layout is the most popular.\n\n\n=== Norwegian ===\n\nThe Norwegian languages use the same letters as Danish, but the Norwegian keyboard differs from the Danish layout regarding the placement of the \u00d8, \u00c6 and \\ (backslash) keys. On the Danish keyboard, the \u00d8 and \u00c6 are swapped. The Swedish keyboard is also similar to the Norwegian layout, but \u00d8 and \u00c6 are replaced with \u00d6 and \u00c4. On some systems, the Norwegian keyboard may allow typing \u00d6/\u00f6 and \u00c4/\u00e4 by holding the AltGr or \u2325 Option key while striking \u00d8 and \u00c6, respectively.\nThere is also an alternative keyboard layout called Norwegian with S\u00e1mi, which allows for easier input of the characters required to write various S\u00e1mi languages. All the S\u00e1mi characters are accessed through the AltGr key.\nOn Macintosh computers, the Norwegian and Norwegian extended keyboard layouts have a slightly different placement for some of the symbols obtained with the help of the \u21e7 Shift or \u2325 Option keys. Notably, the $ sign is accessed with \u21e7 Shift+4 and \u00a2 with \u21e7 Shift+\u2325 Option+4. Furthermore, the frequently used @ is placed between \u00c6 and Return.\n\n\n=== Polish ===\n\nMost typewriters use a QWERTZ keyboard with Polish letters (with diacritical marks) accessed directly (officially approved as \"Typist's keyboard\", Polish: klawiatura maszynistki, Polish Standard PN-87), which is mainly ignored in Poland as impractical (custom-made keyboards, e.g., those in the public sector as well as some Apple computers, present an exception to this paradigm); the \"Polish programmer's\" (Polish: polski programisty) layout has become the de facto standard, used on virtually all computers sold on the Polish market.\nMost computer keyboards in Poland are laid out according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the AltGr key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to Shift and Caps Lock keys. For example, to enter \"\u0179\", one can type \u21e7 Shift+AltGr+X with Caps Lock off, or turn on Caps Lock and type AltGr+X.\nBoth ANSI and ISO mechanical layouts are common sights, and even some non-standard mechanical layouts are in use. ANSI is often preferred, as the additional key provides no additional function, at least in Microsoft Windows where it duplicates the backslash key, while taking space from the Shift key. Many keyboards do not label AltGr as such, leaving the Alt marking as in the US layout \u2013 the right Alt key nevertheless functions as AltGr in this layout, causing possible confusion when keyboard shortcuts with the Alt key are required (these usually work only with the left Alt) and causing the key to be commonly referred to as right Alt (Polish: prawy Alt). However, keyboards with AltGr marking are available and it is also officially used by Microsoft when depicting the layout.\n\nAlso, on MS Windows, the tilde character \"~\" (\u21e7 Shift+`) acts as a dead key to type Polish letters (with diacritical marks) thus, to obtain an \"\u0141\", one may press \u21e7 Shift+`L. The tilde character is obtained with \u21e7 Shift+`Space.\nIn Linux-based systems, the euro symbol is typically mapped to Alt+5 instead of Alt+U, the tilde acts as a normal key, and several accented letters from other European languages are accessible through combinations with left Alt. Polish letters are also accessible by using the Compose key.\nSoftware keyboards on touchscreen devices usually make the Polish diacritics available as one of the alternatives which show up after long-pressing the corresponding Latin letter. However, modern predictive text and autocorrection algorithms largely mitigate the need to type them directly on such devices.\n\n\n=== Portuguese ===\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\n\nThe Brazilian computer keyboard layout is specified in the ABNT NBR 10346 variant 2 (alphanumeric portion) and 10347 (numeric portion) standards.\nEssentially, the Brazilian keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics in use in the language; the letter \u00c7, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key. In some keyboard layouts the AltGr+C combination produces the \u20a2 character (Unicode 0x20A2), symbol for the old currency cruzeiro, a symbol that is not used in practice (the common abbreviation in the eighties and nineties used to be Cr$). The cent sign \u00a2, is accessible via AltGr+5, but is not commonly used for the centavo, subunit of previous currencies as well as the current real, which itself is represented by R$. The Euro sign \u20ac is not standardized in this layout. The masculine and feminine ordinals \u00aa and \u00ba are accessible via AltGr combinations. The section sign \u00a7 (Unicode U+00A7), in Portuguese called par\u00e1grafo, is nowadays practically only used to denote sections of laws.\nVariant 2 of the Brazilian keyboard, the only which gained general acceptance (MS Windows treats both variants as the same layout), has a unique mechanical layout, combining some features of the ISO 9995-3 and the JIS keyboards in order to fit 12 keys between the left and right Shift (compared to the American standard of 10 and the international of 11). Its modern, IBM PS/2-based variations, are thus known as 107-keys keyboards, and the original PS/2 variation was 104-key. Variant 1, never widely adopted, was based on the ISO 9995-2 keyboards. To make this layout usable with keyboards with only 11 keys in the last row, the rightmost key (/?\u00b0) has its functions replicated across the AltGr+Q, AltGr+W, and AltGr+E combinations.\n\n\n==== Portugal ====\n\nEssentially, the Portuguese keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics; the letter \u00c7, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key, but there are also a dedicated key for the ordinal indicators and a dedicated key for quotation marks. The AltGr+E combination for producing the euro sign \u20ac (Unicode 0x20AC) has become standard. On some QWERTY keyboards the key labels are translated, but the majority are labelled in English.\nDuring the 20th century, a different keyboard layout, HCESAR, was in widespread use in Portugal.\n\n\n=== Romanian (in Romania and Moldova) ===\n\nThe current Romanian National Standard SR 13392:2004 establishes two layouts for Romanian keyboards: a \"primary\" one and a \"secondary\" one.\nThe \"primary\" layout is intended for traditional users who have learned how to type with older, Microsoft-style implementations of the Romanian keyboard. The \"secondary\" layout is mainly used by programmers as it does not contradict the physical arrangement of keys on a US-style keyboard. The \"secondary\" arrangement is used as the default Romanian layout by Linux distributions, as defined in the \"X Keyboard Configuration Database\".\nThere are four Romanian-specific characters that are incorrectly implemented in versions of Microsoft Windows until Vista came out:\n\n\u0218 (U+0218, S with comma), incorrectly implemented as \u015e (U+015E, S with cedilla)\n\u0219 (U+0219, s with comma), incorrectly implemented as \u015f (U+015F, s with cedilla)\n\u021a (U+021A, T with comma), incorrectly implemented as \u0162 (U+0162, T with cedilla)\n\u021b (U+021B, t with comma), incorrectly implemented as \u0163 (U+0163, t with cedilla)\nThe cedilla-versions of the characters do not exist in the Romanian language (they came to be used due to a historic bug). The UCS now says that encoding this was a mistake because it messed up Romanian data and the letters with cedilla and the letters with comma are the same letter with a different style.\nSince Romanian hardware keyboards are not widely available, Cristian Secar\u0103 has created a driver that allows Romanian characters to be generated with a US-style keyboard in all versions of Windows prior to Vista through the use of the AltGr key modifier.\nWindows Vista and newer versions include the correct diacritical signs in the default Romanian Keyboard layout.\nThis layout has the Z and Y keys mapped like in English layouts and also includes characters like the 'at' (@) and dollar ($) signs, among others. The older cedilla-version layout is still included albeit as the 'Legacy' layout.\n\n\n=== Slovak ===\n\nIn Slovakia, similarly to the Czech Republic, both QWERTZ and QWERTY keyboard layouts are used. QWERTZ is the default keyboard layout for Slovak in Microsoft Windows.\n\n\n=== Spanish ===\n\n\n==== Spain ====\n\nThe Spanish keyboard layout is used to write in Spanish and in other languages of Spain such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Aragonese, Asturian and Occitan. It includes \u00d1 for Spanish, Asturian and Galician, the acute accent, the diaeresis, the inverted question and exclamation marks (\u00bf, \u00a1), the superscripted o and a (\u00ba, \u00aa) for writing abbreviated ordinal numbers in masculine and feminine in Spanish and Galician, and finally, some characters required only for typing Catalan and Occitan, namely \u00c7, the grave accent and the interpunct (punt volat / punt interior, used in l\u00b7l, n\u00b7h, s\u00b7h; located at Shift-3). It can also be used to write other international characters, such as those using a circumflex accent (used in French and Portuguese among others) or a tilde (used in both Spanish and Portuguese), which are available as dead keys. However, it lacks two characters used in Asturian: \u1e24 and \u1e36 (historically, general support for these two has been poor \u2013 they aren't present in the ISO 8859-1 character encoding standard, or any other ISO/IEC 8859 standard). Several alternative distributions, based on this one or created from scratch, have been created to address this issue (see the Other original layouts and layout design software section for more information).\nOn most keyboards, \u20ac is marked as Alt Gr + E and not Alt Gr + 5 as shown in the image. However, in some keyboards, \u20ac is found marked twice. An alternative version exists, supporting all of ISO 8859-1.\nSpanish keyboards are usually labelled in Spanish instead of English, its abbreviations being:\n\nOn some keyboards, the c-cedilla key (\u00c7) is located one or two lines above, rather than on the right of, the acute accent key (\u00b4). In some cases it is placed on the right of the plus sign key (+), while in other keyboards it is situated on the right of the inverted exclamation mark key (\u00a1).\n\n\n==== Latin America, officially known as Spanish Latinamerican sort ====\n\nThe Latin American Spanish keyboard layout is used throughout Mexico, Central and South America. Before its design, Latin American vendors had been selling the Spanish (Spain) layout as default.\nIts most obvious difference from the Spanish (Spain) layout is the lack of a \u00c7 key; on Microsoft Windows, it lacks a tilde (~) dead key, whereas on Linux systems the dead tilde can be optionally enabled. This is not a problem when typing in Spanish, but it is rather problematic when typing in Portuguese, which can be an issue in countries with large commercial ties to Brazil (Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay).\nNormally \"Bloq May\u00fas\" is used instead of \"Caps Lock\", and \"Intro\" instead of \"Enter\".\n\n\n=== Swedish ===\n\nThe central characteristics of the Swedish keyboard are the three additional letters \u00c5/\u00e5, \u00c4/\u00e4, and \u00d6/\u00f6. The same visual layout is also in use in Finland and Estonia, as the letters \u00c4/\u00e4 and \u00d6/\u00f6 are shared with the Swedish language, and even \u00c5/\u00e5 is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns. However, the Finnish multilingual keyboard adds new letters and punctuation to the functional layout.\nThe Norwegian keyboard largely resembles the Swedish layout, but the \u00d6 and \u00c4 are replaced with \u00d8 and \u00c6. The Danish keyboard is also similar, but it has the \u00d8 and \u00c6 swapped. On some systems, the Swedish or Finnish keyboard may allow typing \u00d8/\u00f8 and \u00c6/\u00e6 by holding the AltGr or \u2325 Option key while striking \u00d6 and \u00c4, respectively.\nThe Swedish with S\u00e1mi keyboard allows typing not only \u00d8/\u00f8 and \u00c6/\u00e6, but even the letters required to write various S\u00e1mi languages. This keyboard has the same function for all the keys engraved on the regular Swedish keyboard, and the additional letters are available through the AltGr key.\nOn Macintosh computers, the Swedish and Swedish Pro keyboards differ somewhat from the image shown above, especially as regards the characters available using the \u21e7 Shift or \u2325 Option keys. \u21e7 Shift+\u00a7 (on the upper row) produces the \u00b0 sign, and \u21e7 Shift+4 produces the \u20ac sign. The digit keys produce \u00a9@\u00a3$\u221e\u00a7 with \u2325 Option and \u00a1\"\u00a5\u00a2\u2030\u00b6\\{}\u2260 with \u2325 Option+\u21e7 Shift.\nOn Linux systems, the Swedish keyboard may also give access to additional characters as follows:\n\nfirst row: AltGr \u00b6\u00a1@\u00a3$\u20ac\u00a5{[]}\\\u00b1 and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift \u00be\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3\u00bc\u00a2\u215d\u00f7\u00ab\u00bb\u00b0\u00bf\u00ac\nsecond row: AltGr @\u0142\u20ac\u00ae\u00fe\u2190\u2193\u2192\u0153\u00fe\"~ and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift \u03a9\u0141\u00a2\u00ae\u00de\u00a5\u2191\u0131\u0152\u00de\u00b0\u02c7\nthird row: AltGr \u00aa\u00df\u00f0\u0111\u014b\u0127j\u0138\u0142\u00f8\u00e6\u00b4 and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift \u00ba\u00a7\u00d0\u00aa\u014a\u0126J&\u0141\u00d8\u00c6\u00d7\nfourth row: AltGr |\u00ab\u00bb\u00a9\"\"n\u00b5\u00b8\u00b7\u0323  and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift \u00a6<>\u00a9\u2018\u2019N\u00ba\u02db\u02d9\u02d9\nSeveral of these characters function as dead keys.\n\n\n=== Turkish ===\n\nToday the majority of Turkish keyboards are based on QWERTY (the so-called Q-keyboard layout), although there is also the older F-keyboard layout specifically designed for the language.\n\n\n=== Vietnamese ===\n\nThe Vietnamese keyboard layout is an extended Latin QWERTY layout. The letters \u0102, \u00c2, \u00ca, and \u00d4 are found on what would be the number keys 1\u20134 on the US English keyboard, with 5\u20139 producing the tonal marks (grave accent, hook, tilde, acute accent and dot below, in that order), 0 producing \u0110, = producing the \u0111\u1ed3ng sign (\u20ab) when not shifted, and brackets ([]) producing \u01af and \u01a0.\n\n\n== Multilingual variants ==\n\nMultilingual keyboard layouts, unlike the default layouts supplied for one language and market, try to make it possible for the user to type in any of several languages using the same number of keys. Mostly this is done by adding a further virtual layer in addition to the \u21e7 Shift-key by means of AltGr (or 'right Alt' reused as such), which contains a further repertoire of symbols and diacritics used by the desired languages.\nThis section also tries to arrange the layouts in ascending order by the number of possible languages and not chronologically according to the Latin alphabet as usual.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom (Extended) Layout ===\n\n\n==== Windows ====\nFrom Windows XP SP2 onwards, Microsoft has included a variant of the British QWERTY keyboard (the \"United Kingdom Extended\" keyboard layout) that can additionally generate several diacritical marks. This supports input on a standard physical UK keyboard for many languages without changing positions of frequently used keys, which is useful when working with text in Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Irish \u2014 languages native to parts of the UK (Wales, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively).\nIn this layout, the grave accent key (`\u00a6) becomes, as it also does in the US International layout, a dead key modifying the character generated by the next key pressed. The apostrophe, double-quote, tilde and circumflex (caret) keys are not changed, becoming dead keys only when 'shifted' with AltGr. Additional precomposed characters are also obtained by shifting the 'normal' key using the AltGr key. The extended keyboard is software installed from the Windows control panel, and the extended characters are not normally engraved on keyboards.\nThe UK Extended keyboard uses mostly the AltGr key to add diacritics to the letters a, e, i, n, o, u, w and y (the last two being used in Welsh) as appropriate for each character, as well as to their capitals. Pressing the key and then a character that does not take the specific diacritic produces the behaviour of a standard keyboard. The key presses followed by spacebar generate a stand-alone mark.:\n\ngrave accents (e.g. \u00e0, \u00e8, etc.) needed for Scots Gaelic are generated by pressing the grave accent (or 'backtick') key `, which is a dead key, then the letter. Thus `+a produces \u00e0.\nacute accents (e.g. \u00e1) needed for Irish are generated by pressing the AltGr key together with the letter. Thus AltGr+a produces \u00e1; AltGr+\u21e7 Shift+a produces \u00c1.\nthe circumflex diacritic needed for Welsh may be added by AltGr+6, acting as a dead key combination, followed by the letter. Thus AltGr+6 then a produces \u00e2, AltGr+6 then w  produces the letter \u0175.\nSome other languages commonly studied in the UK and Ireland are also supported to some extent:\n\ndiaeresis or umlaut (e.g. \u00e4, \u00eb, \u00f6, etc.) is generated by a dead key combination AltGr+2, then the letter. Thus AltGr+2a produces \u00e4.\ntilde (e.g. \u00e3, \u00f1, \u00f5, etc., as used in Spanish and Portuguese) is generated by dead key combination AltGr+#, then the letter. Thus AltGr+#a produces \u00e3.\ncedilla (e.g. \u00e7) under c is generated by AltGr+C, and the capital letter (\u00c7) is produced by AltGr+\u21e7 Shift+C\nThe AltGr and letter method used for acutes and cedillas does not work for applications which assign shortcut menu functions to these key combinations.\nThese combinations are intended to be mnemonic and designed to be easy to remember: the circumflex accent (e.g. \u00e2) is similar to the free-standing circumflex (caret) (^), printed above the 6 key; the diaeresis/umlaut (e.g. \u00f6) is visually similar to the double-quote (\") above 2 on the UK keyboard; the tilde (~) is printed on the same key as the #.\nThe UK Extended layout is almost entirely transparent to users familiar with the UK layout. A machine with the extended layout behaves exactly as with the standard UK, except for the rarely used grave accent key. This makes this layout suitable for a machine for shared or public use by a user population in which some use the extended functions.\nDespite being created for multilingual users, UK-Extended in Windows does have some gaps \u2014 there are many languages that it cannot cope with, including Romanian and Turkish, and all languages with different character sets, such as Greek and Russian. It also does not cater for thorn (\u00fe, \u00de) in Old English, the \u00df in German, the \u0153 in French, nor for the \u00e5, \u00e6, \u00f8, \u00f0, \u00fe in Nordic languages.\n\n\n==== ChromeOS ====\n\nThe UK Extended layout (a ChromeOS extension) provides all the same combinations as with Windows, but adds many more symbols and dead keys via AltGr.\n\nNotes: Dotted circle (\u25cc) is used here to indicate a dead key. The ` (\"backtick\", grave accent) key is the only one that acts as a free-standing dead key and thus does not respond as shown on the key-cap. All others are invoked by AltGr. \nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+0 (\u00b0) is a degree sign;  AltGr+\u21e7 Shift+M (\u00ba) is a masculine ordinal indicator\n\nDead keys\n`+letter produces grave accents (e.g., \u00e0/\u00c0) (`+` produces a standalone backtick).\nAltGr+2(release)letter produces double dot diacritics (diaeresis or umlaut: e.g., \u00e4/\u00c4)\nAltGr+6(release)letter produces circumflex accents (e.g., \u00e2/\u00c2)\nAltGr+= (release) letter produces (mainly) comma diacritic or cedilla below the letter (e.g., \u015f/\u015e) [In addition, AltGr+c produces \u00e7]\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+= (release) letter produces a hook (diacritic) on vowels (e.g., \u0105/\u0104)\nAltGr+[ same as AltGr+2\nAltGr+] same as AltGr+#\nAltGr+{(release)letter produces overrings  (e.g., \u00e5/\u00c5)\nAltGr+}(release)letter produces macrons  (e.g., \u0101/\u0100)\nAltGr+j(release)letter produces mainly hook above (e.g., \u1ea3/\u1ea2)\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+j(release)letter produces a horn (diacritic) (e.g., \u01b0/\u01af)\nAltGr+;(release)letter produces acute accents (e.g., \u017a/\u0179)\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+;(release)letter produces double acute accents on some letters (e.g., \u0150/\u0151) that exist in Unicode as pre-composed characters\nAltGr+'(release)letter produces acute accents (e.g., \u00e1/\u00c1)\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+'(release)letter produces caron (ha\u010dek)  diacritics (e.g., \u01ce/\u01cd)\nAltGr+#(release)letter produces tilde diacritics (e.g., \u00e3/\u00c3)\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+#(release)letter produces inverted breve  diacritics (e.g., \u0103/\u0102)\nAltGr+/(release)letter produces mainly underdots  (e.g., \u1ea1/\u1ea0)\nAltGr+\u21e7 Shift+/(release)letter produces mainly overdots  (e.g., \u0227/\u0226)\nFinally, any arbitrary Unicode glyph can be produced given its hexadecimal code point: ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+u, release, then the hex value, then space bar or \u21a9 Return. For example ctrl+\u21e7 Shift+u (release) 1234space produces the Ethiopic syllable SEE, \u1234.\n\n\n=== US-International ===\n\nWindows provides an alternative layout for a US keyboard to type diacritics, called the US-International layout. Linux and ChromeOS (which calls it the International/Extended keyboard) also provide this layout with slight modifications such as many more AltGr combinations.\nThe layout is installed from the settings panel. The additional functions (shown in blue) may or may not be engraved on the keyboard, but are always functional. It can be used to type most major languages from Western Europe: Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Finnish, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scots Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish. It is not sufficient for French because it lacks the grapheme \u201c\u0153/\u0152\u201d (as does every keyboard layout provided by Windows except the Canadian multilingual standard keyboard). Some less common western and central European languages (such as Welsh, Maltese, Czech and Hungarian), are not fully supported. If the keyboard does not have an AltGr key, the right-hand Alt is used. If that key does not exist (which is true of many laptops) the combination Ctrl+Alt works as well.\nThis layout uses keys ', `, \", ^ and ~ as dead keys to generate characters with diacritics by pressing the appropriate key, then the letter on the keyboard. Only certain letters such as vowels and \"n\", work, otherwise the symbol is produced followed by the typed letter. To get only the symbol ', `, \", ^ and ~, press the Spacebar after the key.\n\n' + vowel \u2192 vowel with acute accent, e.g., '+e \u2192 \u00e9\n` + vowel \u2192 vowel with grave accent, e.g., `+e \u2192 \u00e8\n\" + vowel \u2192 vowel with diaeresis (or umlaut), e.g., \"+e \u2192 \u00eb\n^ + vowel \u2192 vowel with circumflex accent, e.g., ^+e \u2192 \u00ea\n~ + a, n or o \u2192 letter with tilde, e.g. ~+n \u2192 \u00f1, ~+o \u2192 \u00f5\n' + c \u2192 \u00e7 (Windows) or \u0107 (X11)\nThe layout is not entirely transparent to users familiar with the conventional US layout as the dead keys act different (they don't appear immediately and produce accented letters depending on what letter is typed next). This could be disconcerting on a machine for shared or public use. There are alternatives, such as requiring AltGr to be held down to get the dead-key function.\n\n\n==== US-International in the Netherlands ====\n\nThe Dutch layout is historical, and keyboards with this layout are rarely used. Instead, the standard keyboard layout in the Netherlands is US-International, as the Dutch language heavily relies on diacritics and the US-International keyboard provides easy access to diacritics using dead keys. While many US keyboards do not have AltGr or extra US-International characters engraved on them, Dutch keyboards typically have the AltGr engraved at the location of the right Alt key, and have the euro sign \u20ac engraved next to the 5 key.\n\n\n=== Apple International English Keyboard ===\n\nThere are three kinds of Apple Keyboards for English: the United States, the United Kingdom and International English. The International English version features the same changes as the United Kingdom version, only without substituting # for the \u00a3 symbol on \u21e7 Shift+3, and as well lacking visual indication for the \u20ac symbol on \u2325 Option+2 (although this shortcut is present with all Apple QWERTY layouts).\nDifferences from the US layout are:\n\nThe ~` key is located on the left of the Z key, and the |\\ key is located on the right of the \"' key.\nThe \u00b1\u00a7 key is added on the left of the !1 key.\nThe left \u21e7 Shift key is shortened and the Return key has the shape of inverted L.\n\n\n=== Canadian Multilingual Standard ===\n\nThe Canadian Multilingual Standard keyboard layout is used by some Canadians. Though the caret (^) is missing, it is easily inserted by typing the circumflex accent followed by a space.\n\n\n=== Finnish multilingual ===\n\nThe visual layout used in Finland is basically the same as the Swedish layout. This is practical, as Finnish and Swedish share the special characters \u00c4/\u00e4 and \u00d6/\u00f6, and while the Swedish \u00c5/\u00e5 is unnecessary for writing Finnish, it is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns and to write Swedish family names which are common.\nAs of 2008, there is a new standard for the Finnish multilingual keyboard layout, developed as part of a localization project by CSC. All the engravings of the traditional Finnish\u2013Swedish visual layout have been retained, so there is no need to change the hardware, but the functionality has been extended considerably, as additional characters (e.g., \u00c6/\u00e6, \u018f/\u0259, \u01b7/\u0292) are available through the AltGr key, as well as dead keys, which allow typing a wide variety of letters with diacritics (e.g., \u00c7/\u00e7, \u01e4/\u01e5, \u01ee/\u01ef).\nBased on the Latin letter repertory included in the Multilingual European Subset No. 2 (MES-2) of the Unicode standard, the layout has three main objectives. First, it provides for easy entering of text in both Finnish and Swedish, the two official languages of Finland, using the familiar keyboard layout but adding some advanced punctuation options, such as dashes, typographical quotation marks, and the non-breaking space (NBSP).\nSecond, it is designed to offer an indirect but intuitive way to enter the special letters and diacritics needed by the other three Nordic national languages (Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic) as well as the regional and minority languages (Northern S\u00e1mi, Southern S\u00e1mi, Lule S\u00e1mi, Inari S\u00e1mi, Skolt S\u00e1mi, Romani language as spoken in Finland, Faroese, Kalaallisut also known as Greenlandic, and German).\nAs a third objective, it allows for relatively easy entering of particularly names (of persons, places or products) in a variety of European languages using a more or less extended Latin alphabet, such as the official languages of the European Union (excluding Bulgarian and Greek). Some letters, like \u0141/\u0142 needed for Slavic languages, are accessed by a special \"overstrike\" key combination acting like a dead key.\nInitially the Romanian letters \u0218/\u0219 and \u021a/\u021b (S/s and T/t with comma below) were not supported (the presumption was that \u015e/\u015f and \u0162/\u0163 (with cedilla) would suffice as surrogates), however the layout was updated in 2019 to include the letters with the commas as well.\n\n\n=== EurKEY ===\n\nEurKEY, a multilingual keyboard layout intended for Europeans, programmers and translators which uses the US-standard QWERTY layout as base and adds a third and fourth layer available through the AltGr key and AltGr+\u21e7 Shift. These additional layers provide support for many Western European languages, special characters, the Greek alphabet (via dead keys), and many common mathematical symbols.\nUnlike most of the other QWERTY layouts, which are formal standards for a country or region, EurKEY is not an EU, EFTA or any national standard.\nTo address the ergonomics issue of QWERTY, EurKEY Colemak-DH was also developed a Colmak-DH version with the EurKEY design principles.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\n\nSeveral alternatives to QWERTY have been developed over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic. Nevertheless, none have seen widespread adoption, partly due to the sheer dominance of available keyboards and training. Although some studies have suggested that some of these may allow for faster typing speeds, many other studies have failed to do so, and many of the studies claiming improved typing speeds were severely methodologically flawed or deliberately biased, such as the studies administered by August Dvorak himself before and after World War II. Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits, and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevant \u2013 even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak keyboards \u2013 and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training with a keyboard layout a person has already learned.\nThe most widely used such alternative is the Dvorak keyboard layout; another alternative is Colemak, which is based partly on QWERTY and is claimed to be easier for an existing QWERTY typist to learn while offering several supposed optimisations. Most modern computer operating systems support these and other alternative mappings with appropriate special mode settings, with some modern operating systems allowing the user to map their keyboard in any way they like, but few keyboards are made with keys labeled according to any other standard.\n\n\n== Comparison to other keyboard input systems ==\n\nComparisons have been made between Dvorak, Colemak, QWERTY, and other keyboard input systems, namely stenotype or its electronic implementations. However, stenotype is a fundamentally different system, which relies on phonetics and simultaneous key presses or chords. Although Shorthand (or 'stenography') has long been known as a faster and more accurate typing system, adoption has been limited, possibly due to the historically high cost of equipment, steeper initial learning curve, and low awareness of the benefits within primary education and in the general public.\nThe first typed shorthand machines appeared around 1830, with English versions gaining popularity in the early 1900s. Modern electronic stenotype machines or programs produce output in written language, which provides an experience similar to other keyboard setups that immediately produce legible work.\n\n\n== Half QWERTY ==\n\nA half QWERTY keyboard is a combination of an alpha-numeric keypad and a QWERTY keypad, designed for mobile phones. In a half QWERTY keyboard, two characters share the same key, which reduces the number of keys and increases the surface area of each key, useful for mobile phones that have little space for keys. It means that 'Q' and 'W' share the same key and the user must press the key once to type 'Q' and twice to type 'W'.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHCESAR\nJCUKEN\nColemak Keyboard\nDvorak keyboard layout\nKALQ keyboard split-screen touchscreen thumb-typing Android-only 2013 beta\nKeyboard monument\nMaltron keyboard\nPath dependence\nRepetitive strain injury\nText entry interface\nThumb keyboard\nTouch typing\nVelotype\nVirtual keyboard\nWASD\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nArticle on QWERTY and Path Dependence from EH.NET's Encyclopedia\nQWERTY Keyboard History\nQWERTY Keyboard in Mobiles\nAndroid phones with QWERTY keyboards"}}}}
